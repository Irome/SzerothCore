1. Use [build_all] to build all scripts.
2. If certain script has compile error, check your IDE or compiler version and SDK version wheather it's same with all CMDs then you can change it yourself.
3. My setting is VS2017, SDK version 17763, RelwithDefInfo|Win32. I consider add more settings such as x64 or Win8.1 etc.
